The Rust team is happy to announce the latest version of Rust, 1.12.0. Rust is
a systems programming language with the slogan "fast, reliable, productive:
pick three."

As always, you can [install Rust 1.12.0][install] from the appropriate page on our
website, and check out the [detailed release notes for 1.12.0][notes] on GitHub.
1361 patches were landed in this release.

### What's in 1.12.0 stable

The release of 1.12 might be one of the most significant Rust releases since
1.0. We have a lot to cover, but if you don't have time for that, here's a
summary:

The largest user-facing change in 1.12 stable is the new error message format
emitted by `rustc`. We've [previously talked] about this format and this is the
first stable release where they are broadly available. These error messages are
a result of the effort of many hours of [volunteer effort] to design, test, and
update every one of `rustc`s errors to the new format. We're excited to see
what you think of them:

The largest internal change in this release is moving to a new compiler backend
based on the new Rust [MIR]. While this feature does not result in anything
user-visible today, it paves the way for a number of future compiler
optimizations, and for some codebases it already results in improvements to
compile times and reductions in code size.

#### Overhauled error messages

With 1.12 we're introducing a new error format which helps to surface a lot of
the internal knowledge about why an error is occurring to you, the developer.
It does this by putting your code front and center, highlighting the parts
relevant to the error with annotations describing what went wrong.

For example, in 1.11 if a implementation of a trait didn't match the trait
declaration, you would see an error like the one below:

![An old mismatched trait
error](/images/2016-09-Rust-1.12/old-mismatched-trait-error.png)

In the new error format we represent the error by instead showing the points in
the code that matter the most. Here is the relevant line in the trait
declaration, and the relevant line in the implementation, using labels to
describe why they don't match:

![A new mismatched trait
error](/images/2016-09-Rust-1.12/mismatched-trait-error.png)

Initially, this error design was built to aid in understanding borrow-checking
errors, but we found, as with the error above, the format can be broadly
applied to a wide variety of errors. If you would like to learn more about the
design, check out the [previous blog post on the subject][err].

[err]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html

Finally, you can also get these errors as JSON with a flag. Remember that error
we showed above, at the start of the post? Here's an example of attempting to
compile that code while passing the `--error-format=json` flag:

```bash
$ rustc borrowck-assign-comp.rs --error-format=json
{"message":"cannot assign to `p.x` because it is borrowed","level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"borrowck-assign-comp.rs","byte_start":562,"byte_end":563,"line_start":15,"line_end":15,"column_start":14,"column_end":15,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    let q = &p;","highlight_start":14,"highlight_end":15}],"label":"borrow of `p.x` occurs here","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null}],"label":"assignment to borrowed `p.x` occurs here","suggested_replacement":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}
{"message":"aborting due to previous error","code":null,"level":"error","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}
```

We've actually elided a bit of this for brevity's sake, but you get the idea.
This output is primarily for tooling; we are continuing to invest in supporting
IDEs and other useful development tools. This output is a small part of that
effort.

#### MIR code generation

The new Rust "mid-level IR", usually called "MIR", gives the compiler a simpler
way to think about Rust code than its previous way of operating entirely on the
Rust abstract syntax tree. It makes analysis and optimizations possible that
have historically been difficult to implement correctly. The first of many
upcoming changes to the compiler enabled by MIR is a rewrite of the pass that
generates LLVM IR, what `rustc` calls "translation", and after many months of
effort the MIR-based backend has proved itself ready for prime-time.

MIR exposes perfect information about the program's control flow, so the
compiler knows exactly whether types are moved or not. This means that it knows
statically whether or not the value's destructor needs to be run. In cases
where a value may or may not be moved at the end of a scope, the compiler now
simply uses a single bitflag on the stack, which is in turn easier for
optimization passes in LLVM to reason about. The end result is less work for
the compiler and less bloat at runtime. In addition, because MIR is a simpler
'language' than the full AST, it's also easier to implement compiler passes on,
and easier to verify that they are correct.

#### Other improvements

* Many minor improvements to the documentation.
* [`rustc` supports three new MUSL targets on ARM: `arm-unknown-linux-musleabi`,
  `arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf`, and `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf`]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35060).
  These targets produce statically-linked binaries. There are no binary release
  builds yet though.
* In error descriptions,
  [references](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35611) and [unknown numeric
  types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35080) have more human-friendly errors.
* [The compiler can now be built against LLVM 3.9]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35594)
* [Test binaries now support a `--test-threads` argument to specify the number
  of threads used to run tests, and which acts the same as the
  `RUST_TEST_THREADS` environment variable]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35414)  
* [The test runner now emits a warning when tests run over 60 seconds]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35405)
* [Rust releases now come with source packages that can be installed by rustup
  via `rustup component add rust-src`]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34366).
  The resulting source code can be used by tools and IDES, located in the
  sysroot under `lib/rustlib/src`.

See the [detailed release notes][notes] for more.

#### Library stabilizations

This release sees a number of small quality of life improvements for various
types in the standard library:

* [`Cell::as_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html#method.as_ptr)
  and
  [`RefCell::as_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.as_ptr)
* `IpAddr`, `Ivp4Addr`, and `Ipv6Addr` have a few new methods.
* [`LinkedList`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/linked_list/struct.LinkedList.html#method.contains)
  and
  [`VecDeque`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/vec_deque/struct.VecDeque.html#method.contains)
  have a new `contains` method.
* [`iter::Product`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Product.html) and
  [`iter::Sum`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Sum.html)
* [`Option` implements `From` for its contained type]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34828)
* [`Cell`, `RefCell` and `UnsafeCell` implement `From` for their contained type]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35392)
* [`Cow<str>` implements `FromIterator` for `char`, `&str` and `String`]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35064)
* [Sockets on Linux are correctly closed in subprocesses via `SOCK_CLOEXEC`]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34946)
* [`String` implements `AddAssign`]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34890)
* [Unicode definitions have been updated to 9.0]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34599)

See the [detailed release notes][notes] for more.

#### Cargo features

The biggest feature added to Cargo this cycle is the ability to [override the
source of a crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2857). Using this
with tools like [cargo-vendor] and [cargo-local-registry] allow vendoring
dependencies locally in a robust fashion. Eventually this support will be the
foundation of supporting mirrors of [crates.io] as well.

[cargo-vendor]: https://github.com/alexcrichton/cargo-vendor
[cargo-local-registry]: https://github.com/alexcrichton/cargo-local-registry
[crates.io]: https://crates.io/

There are some other improvments as well:

* [Speed up noop registry updates](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2974)
* [Add a `--lib` flag to `cargo new`]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2921)
* [Indicate the compilation profile after compiling]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2909)
* [Add `--dry-run` to `cargo publish`]
  (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2849)

See the [detailed release notes][notes] for more.
