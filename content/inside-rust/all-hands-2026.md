Last May, more than 150 project members and invited guests came together at the largest in-person collaborative event in the history of the Rust project: the Rust All Hands 2025.

During two full days, spread over 10 different meeting rooms, both [pre-planned](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G07-f2pwAzEztZMpuxcCW3EWFS1pEX4ShNbsg91Qqjw/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and ad-hoc [discussions][notes] took place on a very wide range of topics.

Many many long standing issues have been unblocked. Many new ideas were discussed, both small and big. Conflicts were resolved. Plans were made. And many personal connections were formed and improved. ❤

The feedback from the participants was overwhelmingly positive with an average score of 9.5/10. The vast majority would like this to happen again next year, which is exactly what is happening!
