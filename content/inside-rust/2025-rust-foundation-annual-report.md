The Rust Foundation has published two documents today, addressing what their funding supported in
2025 and their 2026-2028 strategic plan.

[The 2025 Annual
Report](https://rustfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-Annual-Report.pdf) details the
Foundation's finances and how the Foundation supported the Project last year. For the people behind
the finances and all the work they've done, see the Foundation's [2025 Year In
Review](https://rustfoundation.org/2025/), which you may have seen in December.

Looking forward to the next 3 years, the Foundation staff worked with the Leadership Council,
Project Directors, and surveyed the Project as a whole to inform their Strategic Goals for
2026-2028. The 5 areas the Foundation will be concentrating on are:

- Stable, secure infrastructure
- Sustainable support for maintainers
- Responsible growth in adoption
- Meaningful engagement from organizations that rely on Rust
- Building and supporting strong, connected global communities

[View the Rust Foundation's full strategic plan](https://rustfoundation.org/strategic-plan/) for
more details, examples, and goals.

We look forward to working with the Foundation towards these goals over the next 3 years!
