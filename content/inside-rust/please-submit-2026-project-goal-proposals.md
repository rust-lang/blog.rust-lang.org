# Please submit 2026 Project goal proposals

The proposals for the 2026 goal period are open, you can submit yours right now.

We are accepting proposals **until the end of January 2026**.

Go to the [Propose a new goal](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/how_to/propose_a_goal.html) page to learn how (tl;dr copy [TEMPLATE.md][template], fill it in and open a PR for the [rust-project-goals](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals) repo). The text doen't have to be complete. We can work with you and fill things in later.

[template]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/blob/main/src/TEMPLATE.md

We're now running the whole program throughout the full year: getting the nominations and writing the RFC at the beginning, with the RFC and official start in April and publish check-ins in July and October.

But if you're a Project member and have all the team asks (reviews, design bandwidth etc.) sorted out, you can propose and start a goal at any time.

We also simplified the [template][template]: the `Metadata` section is shorter and [the `Team asks` section](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/blob/main/src/TEMPLATE.md#team-asks) now focuses on the *what level support you need from each team*.

There are four levels: `Vibes` (does the team like this?), `Small` (the team only needs to do routine activities, e.g. small reviews/approvals), `Medium` (you need dedicated support from one person) and `Large` (deep involvement from the entire team).

This clarifies the need for champions (only for medium/large support levels) and should make the team approval easier as they can clearly see what is actually requested here and compare it to their capacity.


Want to talk to us? Drop by our Zulip in [#project-goals/2026-workshop](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/546987-project-goals.2F2026-workshop). We can answer any questions you have, discuss the goal before you commit and help you put it together.
