- [Kobzol](https://github.com/Kobzol), team member
  - Kobzol is a prolific member of the infrastructure team and has also been making great
    contributions to the team's performance triaging, our transition to lld as well as many varied
    improvements to the compiler itself.
- [ZuseZ4](https://github.com/ZuseZ4), team member
  - ZuseZ4 is the maintainer of the [Enzyme](https://enzyme.mit.edu/) logic in our LLVM backend and
    our new automatic differentiation support.
- [jdonszelmann](https://github.com/jdonszelmann), team member
  - jdonszelmann has been making significant contributions to how we represent attributes in the HIR
    and helped organise the Rust All Hands this year, enabling the team to meet in person.

  - madsmtm is our Apple and iOS target maintainer and expert on the issues and regressions that
    come up with these targets.
