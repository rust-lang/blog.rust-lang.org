The compiler team had our weekly triage meeting on 2019-10-24.
You can find the [minutes](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/minutes/triage-meeting/2019-10-24/) on the [compiler-team](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team) repository.
Each week, we have general announcements from the team followed by check-ins from two fo the compiler team working groups.

## Announcements

- [@simulacrum](https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum) landed the rust-std split PR which decreases the size of the rustc-dev rustup component [#65474](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65474)

## Working group sync

### [wg-nll](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/nll/)

- Rust 1.40 (current nightly) will be the first stable release without the HIR borrow checker.
This means Non Lexical Lifetimes will be available on Rust 2015.

- At this point, wg-nll has completed its purpose and will be disbanded.
  - wg-polonius is still going strong though!

### [wg-parallel-rustc](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/parallel-rustc/)

- Work is proceeding slowly but steadily.
There are regular triage meetings every Monday on the compiler calendar.

- The current goal is to refactor/audit compiler locks and other parts of the parallel query system and to investigate improving performance.

- The current MVP is to do high-level parallelization in a few critical places such as typechecking & linting.

- Currently, we're not seeing the speedups we want from parallelization but work is ongoing to remove locking and improve the jobserver integration.
