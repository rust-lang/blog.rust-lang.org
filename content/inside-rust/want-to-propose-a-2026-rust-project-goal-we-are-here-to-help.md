Are there changes to Rust that you, or your organization, would like to make happen? Do you need advice in getting started with that? The Rust Project Goals team is here to help!

We are currently beginning the "pre-planning" for the Rust 2026 goals. **In this "pre-planning" phase, we are looking for people who have ideas for things they want to do but who are not sure how to interface with the Rust org to see it happen.** We are particularly interested in supporting organizations and groups, which often have a harder time connecting to open source.

## What is the Project Goals program?

A **project goal** is a kind of a contract between you and the Rust project teams. When you propose a project goal, **you are promising to do the work you describe**. When the Rust teams approve your goal, **they are committing to support you** (e.g., by doing reviews, giving feedback, etc). To make sure this happens, every approved Rust project goal has a **champion**, a Rust team member or affiliate that will meet regularly with you and help ensure you stay unblocked.

## 2026 goals will run annually

For 2026, we are shifting to annual project goals (though a goal doesn't have to take the whole year). In the past, goals covered six month periods like [2025H1][] and [2025H2][].

[2025H1]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h1/index.html
[2025H2]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h2/index.html

## The goals timeline

| Time period | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| Dec 2025 (now!) | We are soliciting pre-proposals and assessing which [2025H2] goals will continue into 2026 |
