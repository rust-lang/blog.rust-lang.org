We are very excited to announce that, after six years, we will finally have another Rust All Hands event in 2025!

The Rust All Hands is an event for all members of the Rust project to come together in person to collaborate on the future of Rust. The last Rust All Hands took place in Berlin in 2019, so another one has been long overdue.

The Rust All Hands 2025 will take place in **Utrecht, the Netherlands** as part of [Rust Week 2025], hosted by [RustNL].

That week will include, among other things, a "10 years of Rust" celebration on **15 May 2025**
and the Rust All Hands on **16 and 17 May 2025**, both at the same venue.

If you are interested in being part of the Rust All Hands 2025,
please [register your interest here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeoEsZGLGokSK0Gn8GVRHhM23KgbwKsp67oxi79KfdsbipkQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
The form asks for your affiliation with the Rust project;
please indicate that to help us understand who is interested.

We'll be sending out formal invitations at a later point in time.

We hope to see you in Utrecht!
