This is the fifth blog post in [the series started December
2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/17/project-director-update.html) where us Rust
Foundation Project Directors will be sharing the highlights from last month’s Rust Foundation Board
meeting. You’ll find the [full March 2025
minutes](https://rustfoundation.org/resource/march-2025-board-meeting/) on the Rust Foundation’s
site!

Highlights from the March meeting include:

* The 2025 Foundation budget is in good shape, but Bec and other Foundation staff are working on
  ensuring the Foundation can continue funding efforts similarly in 2026 amidst the economic
  uncertainty much of the world is also facing right now. The Foundation is always looking for more
  members; if you’re reading this and the company you work for uses Rust and isn’t yet a member,
  [please reach out](https://rustfoundation.org/get-involved/)!
* Jon Bauman attended the ISO C++ meeting as part of [his work on the C++ interoperability
  initiative][cplusplus], and as a result, some C++ committee members will be attending [Rust
  Week](https://rustweek.org/) in May to continue the collaboration!
* Speaking of Rust Week, the Foundation has awarded around 30 travel grants for Rust Project
  members to attend. Thank you for this support!
