This is the eighth blog post in [the series started December 2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/17/project-director-update.html) where us Rust Foundation Project Directors share the highlights from previous months’ Rust Foundation Board meeting(s). Here are our highlights from [November’s board meeting](https://rustfoundation.org/resource/november-2025-board-meeting/):

* The Rust Foundation Maintainers Fund has started fundraising, and talks are ongoing with the Project on how to structure the fund to be effective and transparent.
* Varied updates from the Foundation’s engineering efforts were provided: An RFC has been published to surface vulnerabilities on [crates.io](http://crates.io); the impact of the tar crate vulnerability was investigated; discussions on [crates.io](http://crates.io) sustainability have been held; Trusted Publishing for GitLab is being tested; and Rust-C++ interop papers have been presented at the C++ WG21 Committee meeting.
* Foundation staff have a draft of Strategic Goals for 2026-2028 that reflected Project member responses to a survey circulated midyear. The draft was provided to the Board for feedback and will be circulated among the Project as well before being brought up for a Board vote in December.
* There was a listening session with Foundation Member Companies who offer Rust training about the progress of the Foundation’s training course and accreditation program. The Members’ feedback is being incorporated to ensure the Foundation’s offerings complement and don’t compete with Members. More to come on the training program in Q1 2026!
* Work on RustConf 2026 is underway; the CFP and sponsorship prospectus will be happening earlier than in previous years to allow for more time for speaker visa processing.
* Seth Markle, the representative from AWS, was elected Treasurer. David Wood, Project Director, was elected Secretary.

See you in 2026!
