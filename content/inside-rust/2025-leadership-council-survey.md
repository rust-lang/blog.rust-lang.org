One of the responsibilities of the [leadership council](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/leadership-council),
formed by [RFC 3392](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3392-leadership-council.html),
is to solicit feedback on a yearly basis from the Project on how we are performing
our duties.

> Each year, the Council must solicit feedback on whether the Council is
> serving its purpose effectively from all willing and able Project members and
> openly discuss this feedback in a forum that allows and encourages active
> participation from all Project members. To do so, the Council and other
> Project members consult the high-level duties, expectations, and constraints
> listed in this RFC and any subsequent revisions thereof to determine if the
> Council is meeting its duties and obligations.

We are runnning a quick annual survey, primarily for Rust project members to
provide feedback on the Leadership Council. However, even if you are not a
member, feel free to fill out the survey too -- we welcome input from those
interacting with the Council in other capacities.

This survey is anonymous. The Council will go through all answers and release a
summary after the survey is complete, similar to the one published
[last year](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/08/26/council-survey/).

Please fill out the survey [here](https://www.surveyhero.com/c/rust-leadership-council-2025). It will be open for 3 weeks, closing
on 2025-07-21.
