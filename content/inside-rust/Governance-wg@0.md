Greetings Rustaceans!

The Rust Governance Working Group held another meeting on Zulip on 23 April.

The agenda included:
1. Follow up on [the Project Group RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2856)
2. Pre-RFC process
3. Domain Working Group Retrospective

You can find the [detailed minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.04.23.md) on the [wg-governance](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance) repository, but here is a quick summary: 
 
# Follow up on the [Project Group RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2856)
* Is in Final comment Period, on track to be merged by the rfcbot

#  Pre-RFC process
* No update at present time

#  Domain Working Group Retrospective
* There is lack of contextual clarity about how domain work relates to the Rust project in general
* First step: Created questionnaire to be shared with Domain WG leads via email to gain clarity on this


## Next meeting
* Our next meeting will be 7 May 2020 via [Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/223182-wg-governance) 17:00 UTC.
