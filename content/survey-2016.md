Rust's first birthday is upon us (on May 15th, 2016), and we want to take this
opportunity to reflect on where we've been, and where we're going. The Rust core
team plans a post next week giving some of their perspective on the year. But we
are also eager to hear from you.

Thus, as part of the celebrations, the community team is pleased to announce the
official [2016 State of Rust Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/HaesyIg73g)!  Whether
or not you use Rust today, we want to know your opinions. Your responses will
help the project understand its strengths and weaknesses, and to establish
development priorities for the future.

Completing this survey should take about 5 to 10 minutes, and is anonymous
unless you choose to give us your contact information. We will be accepting
submissions until June 8th, 2016. If you have any questions, please feel free to
email the Rust Community team at
[community-team@rust-lang.org](mailto:community-team@rust-lang.org).

Please help us spread the word by sharing the above link on your social network
feeds, at meetups, around your office and in other communities.

Thanks, everyone who helped develop, polish, and test the survey! Once it
closes, we will summarize and visualize the results here on
[https://blog.rust-lang.org/](https://blog.rust-lang.org).

Happy birthday, Rust. Have another great year.
