It’s time for the [2023 State of Rust Survey](https://www.surveyhero.com/c/4vxempzc)! 

Since 2016, the Rust Project has collected valuable information and feedback from the Rust programming language community through our annual [State of Rust Survey](https://www.surveyhero.com/c/4vxempzc). This tool allows us to more deeply understand how the Rust Project is performing, how we can better serve the global Rust community, and who our community is composed of.

Like last year, the [2023 State of Rust Survey](https://www.surveyhero.com/c/4vxempzc) will likely take you between 5 and 20 minutes, and responses are anonymous. We will accept submissions until Friday, December 29th, 2023. Trends and key insights will be shared on [blog.rust-lang.org](https://blog.rust-lang.org) as soon as possible in 2024. 

We invite you to take this year’s survey whether you have just begun using Rust, you consider yourself an intermediate to advanced user, or you have not yet used Rust but intend to one day. Your responses will help us improve Rust over time by shedding light on gaps to fill in the community and development priorities, and more.

**Once again, we will be offering the State of Rust Survey in the following languages (if you speak multiple languages, please pick one on the main survey page):**
- English
- Simplified Chinese
- Traditional Chinese
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Korean
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Spanish
- Ukrainian

Please help us spread the word by sharing the [survey link](https://www.surveyhero.com/c/4vxempzc) via your social media networks, at meetups, with colleagues, and in any other community that makes sense to you.

This survey would not be possible without the time, resources, and attention of members of the Survey Working Group, the Rust Foundation, and other collaborators. Thank you! 

If you have any questions, please see our [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/blob/main/documents/Community-Survey-FAQ.md).

We appreciate your participation!
