      <p>Rust 1.0 is on its way! We have nailed down a concrete list of
features and are hard at work on implementing them. We plan to ship
the 1.0 beta around the end of the year. If all goes well, this will
go on to become the 1.0 release after the beta period. After
1.0 is released, future 1.x releases will be backwards compatible,
meaning that existing code will continue to compile unmodified (modulo
compiler bugs, of course).</p>
<p>Of course, a Rust 1.0 release means something more than &quot;your code
will continue to compile&quot;. Basically, it means that we think the
design of Rust finally feels right. More specifically, it feels
<em>minimal</em>. The language itself is now focused on a simple core
concept, which we call ownership and borrowing (more on this
later). Leveraging ownership and borrowing, we have been able to build
up everything else that we have needed in libraries. This is very
exciting, because any library we can write, you can write too. This
really gives us confidence that Rust will not only achieve its
original goals but also go beyond and be used for all kinds of things
that we haven't even envisioned.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-road-to-rust-10" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-road-to-rust-10"></a>The road to Rust 1.0</h3>
<p>Rust has gone through a long evolution. If you haven't looked at Rust
in a while, you may be surprised at what you see: over the last year,
we've been radically simplifying the design. As a prominent example,
Rust once featured several pointer types, indicated by various sigils:
these are gone, and only the reference types (<code>&amp;T</code>, <code>&amp;mut T</code>)
remain. We have also been able to consolidate and simplify a number of
other language features, such as closures, that once sported a wide
variety of options. (Some of these changes are still in progress.)</p>
<p>The key to all these changes has been a focus on the core concepts of
<em>ownership and borrowing</em>. Initially, we introduced ownership as a
means of transferring data safely and efficiently between tasks, but
over time we have realized that the same mechanism allows us to move
all sorts of things out of the language and into libraries. The
resulting design is not only simpler to learn, but it is also much
&quot;closer to the metal&quot; than we ever thought possible before.  All Rust
language constructs have a very direct mapping to machine operations,
and Rust has no required runtime or external dependencies. When used
in its own most minimal configuration, it is even possible to write an
<a href="https://github.com/charliesome/rustboot">operating</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanra/RustOS">systems</a> <a href="https://github.com/jvns/puddle">kernel</a> in Rust.</p>
<p>Throughout these changes, though, Rust has remained true to its goal
of providing the <strong>safety</strong> and <strong>convenience</strong> of modern programming
languages, while still offering the <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>low-level
control</strong> that C and C++ offer. Basically, if you want to get your
hands dirty with the bare metal machine, but you don't want to spend
hours tracking down segfaults and data races, Rust is the language for
you.</p>
<p>If you're not already familiar with Rust, don't worry. Over the next
few months, we plan on issuing a regular series of blog posts
exploring the language. The first few will focus on different aspects
of ownership and how it can be used to achieve safe manual memory
management, concurrency, and more. After that, we'll turn to other
aspects of the Rust language and ecosystem.</p>
<h3><a href="#what-is-left-to-do" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="what-is-left-to-do"></a>What is left to do</h3>
<p>We've made great progress, but there is still a lot to do before the
release. Here is a list of the big-ticket changes we are currently
working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dynamically sized types:</em> This extension to the type system allows
us to uniformly handle types where the size is not known at compile
time, such as an array type. This enables us to support
user-designed smart pointers that contain arrays or
objects. Nicholas Cameron <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/7932b719ec2b65acfa8c3e74aad29346d47ee992">recently landed</a> a heroic commit
implementing the bulk of the work.</li>
<li><em>Unboxed closures:</em> Our new <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0114-closures.md">closure design</a> unifies closures
and object types. Much of the spec has been implemented.</li>
<li><em>Associated types:</em> We are moving our trait system to use
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/195">associated types</a>, which really help to cut down on the level
of generic annotations required to write advanced generic
libraries. Patrick Walton has done an initial implementation.</li>
<li><em>Where clauses:</em> We are adding a flexible new form of constraints
called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/135">where clauses</a>. Patrick Walton already landed support
for the basic syntax, and I have implemented the remaining
functionality on a branch that should be landing soon.</li>
<li><em>Multidispatch traits:</em> We are extending traits so that they
can <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/195">match on more than one type at a time</a>, which opens up a lot of
new opportunities for more ergonomic APIs. I have
prototyped this work on a branch.</li>
<li><em>Destructors:</em> We are improving our destructor semantics to not
require zeroing of memory, which should improve compilation and
execution times. Felix Klock has implemented the requisite analysis
and is in the process of landing it.</li>
<li><em>Green threading:</em> We are removing support for green threading from
the standard library and moving it out into an external
package. This allows for a closer match between the Rust model and
the underlying operating system, which makes for more efficient
programs. Aaron Turon has <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230">written the RFC</a> and is getting
started on that work now.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the library level, we are currently engaged in a sweep over libstd
to decide what portions are stable and which are not. You can
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/stability.html">monitor the progress</a> here. (Note though that many of the
'unstable' items are simply things whose name will be changed slightly
to conform to conventions or other minor tweaks.)</p>
<h3><a href="#cargo-and-the-library-ecosystem" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="cargo-and-the-library-ecosystem"></a>Cargo and the library ecosystem</h3>
<p>Earlier I wrote that Rust 1.0 is not so much an endpoint as it is a
starting point. This is very true. The goal for Rust 1.0 is to be an
flexible substrate for building efficient libraries -- but libraries
aren't any good if nobody can find them or they are difficult to install.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://crates.io">Cargo, the Rust package manager</a>. Cargo has
been undergoing rapid development lately and is already quite
functional. By the time
1.0 is released, we plan to also have a central repository up and
running, meaning that it will be simple to create and distribute Rust
libraries (which we call &quot;crates&quot;). Oh, and of course Cargo and its
associated server are both written in Rust.</p>
<h3><a href="#release-process" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="release-process"></a>Release process</h3>
<p>Rust releases have been following a train schedule for a long time and
we don't plan on changing that. Once we start having stable releases,
however, we'll also build up a bit more infrastructure. Our plan is to
adopt the &quot;channel&quot; system used by many other projects such as
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/">Firefox</a>,
<a href="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">Chrome</a>, and
<a href="http://emberjs.com/builds/">Ember.js</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is that there are three channels: Nightly, Beta, and
Stable. The Nightly channel is what you use if you want the latest
and greatest: it includes unstable features and libraries that may
still change in backwards incompatible ways. Every six weeks, we cut a
new branch and call it Beta. This branch excludes all the unstable
bits, so you know that if you are using Beta or Stable, your code
will continue to compile. At the same time, the existing Beta branch
is promoted to the Stable release. We expect that production users
will prefer to test on the Beta branch and ship with the Stable
branch. Testing on Beta ensures that we get some advanced notice if we
accidentally break anything you are relying on.</p>
<p>With regard to the 1.0 release specifically, the plan is to release
the 1.0 beta and then follow this same process to transition to the
official 1.0 release. However, if we find a serious flaw in the
1.0 beta, we may defer and run an additional beta period or two. After
all, it's better to wait a bit longer than wind up committed to
something broken.</p>
<h3><a href="#looking-forward" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="looking-forward"></a>Looking forward</h3>
<p>In many ways, Rust 1.0 is not so much an endpoint as it is a starting
point. Naturally, we plan on continuing to develop Rust: we have a lot
of features we want to add, many of which are already in the pipeline.
But the work that's most exciting to me is not the work that will be
done by the Rust team. Rather, I expect that having a stable base will
allow the Rust community and ecosystem to grow much more rapidly than
it already has. I can't wait to see what comes out of it.</p>
