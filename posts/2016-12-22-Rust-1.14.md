The Rust team is happy to announce the latest version of Rust, 1.14.0. Rust is a
systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

As always, you can [install Rust 1.14.0][install] from the appropriate page on our
website, and check out the [detailed release notes for 1.14.0][notes] on GitHub.
1230 patches were landed in this release.

### What's in 1.14.0 stable

One of the biggest features in Rust 1.14 isn't actually in the language or
compiler: the [rustup tool has reached a 1.0 release][rustup], and is now the
recommended way to install Rust from the project directly. Rustup does a bit
more than just install Rust:

> rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release
> channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly
> compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling simpler with binary
> builds of the standard library for common platforms. And it runs on all
> platforms Rust supports, including Windows.

We had [a previous post about Rustup][prev] back in May. You can learn more
about it there, or by checking it out [on
GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs).

Another exciting feature is [experimental support for WebAssembly][wasm] as a
target, `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`. It is still early days, and there's a lot
of bugs to shake out, so please give it a try and report them! To give you a
small taste of how it works, once you have [emscripten] installed, compiling
some Rust code to WebAssembly is as easy as:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten
$ echo 'fn main() { println!("Hello, Emscripten!"); }' > hello.rs
$ rustc --target=wasm32-unknown-emscripten hello.rs
$ node hello.js
```

[emscripten]: http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

The community has been doing interesting, experimental work in this area: see
[Jan-Erik's slides] for the workshop he ran at [Rust Belt Rust] for some
examples, or check out [Tim's example of the classic TodoMVC project][todomvc].
This implementation builds off of his [webplatform
crate](https://crates.io/crates/webplatform), which exposes the DOM to Rust.

[Jan-Erik's slides]: http://www.hellorust.com/emscripten/
[Rust Belt Rust]: http://www.rust-belt-rust.com/sessions/
[todomvc]: http://timryan.org/rust-todomvc/

Speaking of platforms, a large number of platforms have gained additional
support:

For `rustc`:

* `mips-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64`
* `mips64el-unknown-linux-gnuabi64`
* `powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `s390x-unknown-linux-gnu`

And for `std`:

* `arm-unknown-linux-musleabi`
* `arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf`
* `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf`

If you're using one of these platforms, follow the instructions on the website
to install, or add the targets to an existing installation with
`rustup target add`.

These platforms are all 'tier 2', please see our page on [platform support] for
more details.

Just like how the community is doing interesting work on the WebAssembly
target, there's also neat things going on with increasing Rust's target support
beyond what's listed above. [xargo] allows for easy cross-compilation of Rust
to bare-metal targets. If you're writing an operating system in Rust, or doing
something interesting on a microcontroller, xargo can make your life a lot
simpler.

The landing of MIR over the last few releases means that a [number of
improvements to compile times] have landed, with more coming in the future.

[number of improvements to compile times]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#compile-time-optimizations

In the language, one small improvement has landed: support for [RFC 1492]. This small
addition lets you use `..` in more places. Previously, say you had a struct like this:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
    z: i32,
}
```

In any context where you're doing a pattern match, you could use `..` to ignore the
parts you don't care about. For example:


```rust
let p = Point { x: 0, y: 1, z: 2 };

match p {
    Point { x, .. } => println!("x is {}", x),
}
```

The `..` ignores `y` and `z`.

Consider a similar `Point`, but as a tuple struct:

```rust
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
```

Previously, you could use `..` to ignore all three elements:

```rust
let p = Point(0, 1, 2);

match p {
    Point(..) => println!("found a point"),
}
```

But you could not use it to only ignore parts of the tuple:

```rust
let p = Point(0, 1, 2);

match p {
    Point(x, ..) => println!("x is {}", x),
}
```

This was an inconsistency, and so with RFC 1492 stabilized, compiles fine as of
this release. This applies to more situations than tuples; please see [the
RFC][RFC 1492] for more details.

[RFC 1492]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1492-dotdot-in-patterns.md

#### Library stabilizations

There have been a number of additions to the standard library, but they don't
fit into particularly nice categories for this release. Here's the highlights:

* [`println!()`, with no arguments, prints newline][36825].
  Previously, an empty string was required to achieve the same.
* [`Wrapping` impls standard binary and unary operators on references, as well
  as the `Sum` and `Product` iterators][37356], making references to these
  types easier to use.
* [Implement `From<Cow<str>> for String` and `From<Cow<[T]>> for
  Vec<T>`][37326]. These implementations make sense, but were not yet added.
* [Expand `.zip()` specialization to `.map()` and `.cloned()`][37230] for improved performance.
* [Implement `RefUnwindSafe` for atomic types][37178], as these types are
  "unwind safe," though that wasn't obvious at first.
* [Specialize `Vec::extend` to `Vec::extend_from_slice`][37094] for performance gains.
* [Don't reuse `HashMap` random seeds][37470]. This helps to mitigate one type
  of DDoS attack.
* [The internal memory layout of `HashMap` is more cache-friendly, for
  significant improvements in some operations][36692]
* [Impl `Add<{str, Cow<str>}>` for `Cow<str>`][36430]. We already support `Add`
  for other string types, so not having it on `Cow` is inconsistent.

See the [detailed release notes][notes] for more.

#### Cargo features

As for Cargo, [RFC 1721] has been implemented. Cargo will now pass along the
values printed by `rustc --print cfg` to build scripts. The motivation for this
feature is that Cargo can now compile objects for statically linking against
the msvcrt on the MSVC platform.

[RFC 1721]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1721-crt-static.md

Cargo now works properly [with a read-only `CARGO_HOME`][3259].

Finally, Cargo will [ignore the `panic` configuration for the `test` and
`bench` profiles][3175]. This is important because the test runner relies on
panics counting as failing tests, and so with `panic=abort`, a failing test
would abort the entire test suite.
