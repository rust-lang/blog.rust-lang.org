title: "Announcing Rustup 1.22.1"

The rustup working group is happy to announce the release of rustup version 1.22.1. [Rustup][install] is the recommended tool to install [Rust][rust], a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

If you have a previous version of rustup installed, getting rustup 1.22.1 may be as easy as closing your IDE and running:

```
rustup self update
```

Rustup will also automatically update itself at the end of a normal toolchain update:

```
rustup update
```

If you don't have it already, or if the 1.22.0 release of rustup caused you to experience the problem that 1.22.1 fixes, you can [get rustup][install] from the appropriate page on our website.

[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org
[install]: https://rustup.rs

## What's new in rustup 1.22.1

When updating dependency crates for 1.22.0, a change in behaviour of the `url` crate slipped in which caused `env_proxy` to cease to work with proxy data set in the environment.  This is unfortunate since those of you who use `rustup` behind a proxy and have updated to 1.22.0 will now find that rustup may not work properly for you.

If you are affected by this, simply [re-download the installer][install] and run it.  It will update your existing installation of Rust with no need to uninstall first.

## Thanks

Thanks to Ivan Nejgebauer who spotted the issue, provided the fix, and made rustup 1.22.1 possible,
and to Ben Chen who provided a fix for our website.
