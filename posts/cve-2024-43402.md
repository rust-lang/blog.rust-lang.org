On April 9th, 2024, the Rust Security Response WG disclosed [CVE-2024-24576][1],
where `std::process::Command` incorrectly escaped arguments when invoking batch
files on Windows. We were notified that our fix for the vulnerability was
incomplete, and it was possible to bypass the fix when the batch file name had
trailing whitespace or periods (which are ignored and stripped by Windows).

The severity of the incomplete fix is **low**, due to the niche conditions
needed to trigger it. Note that calculating the CVSS score might assign a
higher severity to this, but that doesn't take into account what is required to
trigger the incomplete fix.

The incomplete fix is identified by CVE-2024-43402.

## Overview

Refer to [the advisory for CVE-2024-24576][1] for details on the
original vulnerability.

To determine whether to apply the `cmd.exe` escaping rules, the original fix
for the vulnerability checked whether the command name ended with `.bat` or
`.cmd`. At the time that seemed enough, as we refuse to invoke batch scripts
with no file extension.

Unfortunately, [Windows removes trailing whitespace and periods][2] when
parsing file paths. For example, `.bat. .` is interpreted by Windows as `.bat`,
but our original fix didn't check for that.

## Mitigations

If you are affected by this, and you are using Rust 1.77.2 or greater, you can
remove the trailing whitespace (ASCII 0x20) and trailing periods (ASCII 0x2E)
from the batch file name to bypass the incomplete fix and enable the
mitigations.

Rust 1.81.0, due to be released on September 5th 2024, will update the standard
library to apply the [CVE-2024-24576][1] mitigations to all batch files
invocations, regardless of the trailing chars in the file name.

## Affected versions

All Rust versions before 1.81.0 are affected, if your code or one of your
dependencies invoke a batch script on Windows with trailing whitespace or
trailing periods in the name, and pass untrusted arguments to it.

## Acknowledgements
