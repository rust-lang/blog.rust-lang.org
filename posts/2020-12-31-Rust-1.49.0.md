title: "Announcing Rust 1.49.0"
author: The Rust Release Team
release: true
---

The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.49.0. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.49.0 is as easy as:

```console
rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for
1.49.0][notes] on GitHub.

## What's in 1.49.0 stable

For this release, we have some new targets and an improvement to the test
framework. See the [detailed release notes][notes] to learn about other
changes not covered by this post.

### aarch64 targets

We have two big changes to three targets:

* [`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` is now Tier 1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78228)
* [`aarch64-apple-darwin` is now Tier 2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75991)
* [`aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` is now Tier 2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75914)

If you're not familiar with our "tiers" of support, you can read about that
on our [platform support
page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustc/platform-support.html). In
brief, Tier 1 is "guaranteed to work," Tier 2 is "guaranteed to build," and
Tier 3 is "code exists but is not tested." If you're a 64-bit ARM user, these
changes mean that Rust programs will work better on your platforms!

### Test framework captures output in threads

Rust's built-in testing framework doesn't have a ton of features, but that
doesn't mean it can't be improved! Consider a test that looks like this:

```rust
#[test]
fn thready_pass() {
    println!("fee");
    std::thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("fie");
        println!("foe");
    })
    .join()
    .unwrap();
    println!("fum");
}
```

Here's what running this test looks like before Rust 1.49.0:

```text
❯ cargo test
   Compiling threadtest v0.1.0 (C:\threadtest)
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38s
     Running target\debug\deps\threadtest-02f42ffd9836cae5.exe

running 1 test
fie
foe
test thready_pass ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests threadtest

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

You can see that the output from the thread is printed, which intermixes
from the output of the test framework itself. Wouldn't it be nice
if every `println!` worked like that one that prints "`fum`?" Well, [that's
the behavior in Rust 1.49.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78227):

```text
❯ cargo +nightly test
   Compiling threadtest v0.1.0 (C:\threadtest)
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s
     Running target\debug\deps\threadtest-40aabfaa345584be.exe

running 1 test
test thready_pass ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests threadtest

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

But don't worry; if the test were to fail, you'll still see all of the
output. By adding a `panic!` to the end of the test, we can see what failure
looks like:

```text
❯ cargo +nightly test
   Compiling threadtest v0.1.0 (C:\threadtest)
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s
     Running target\debug\deps\threadtest-40aabfaa345584be.exe

running 1 test
test thready_pass ... FAILED

failures:

---- thready_pass stdout ----
fee
fie
foe
fum
thread 'thready_pass' panicked at 'explicit panic', src\lib.rs:11:5
```

Specifically, the test runner makes sure to capture the output, and saves it
in case the test fails.

### Library changes

In Rust 1.49.0, there are three new stable functions:

- [`slice::select_nth_unstable`]
- [`slice::select_nth_unstable_by`]
- [`slice::select_nth_unstable_by_key`]

And two functions were made `const`:

- [`Poll::is_ready`]
- [`Poll::is_pending`]

See the [detailed release notes][notes] to learn about other changes.
