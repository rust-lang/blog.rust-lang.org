title: "Announcing Rust 1.46.0"
author: The Rust Release Team
release: true
---

The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.46.0. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.46.0 is as easy as:

```console
rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for
1.46.0][notes] on GitHub.

[install]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
[notes]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1460-2020-08-27

## What's in 1.46.0 stable

This release is on the smaller side, with a number of improvements to `const
fn`, two new standard library APIs, and one feature useful for library
authors. See the [detailed release notes][notes] to learn about other changes
not covered by this post.

### `#[track_caller]`

Back in March, the release of Rust 1.42 introduced [better error messages when `unwrap()` and related functions would panic][better-errors]. At the time, we mentioned that the way
this was implemented was not yet stable. Rust 1.46 stabilizes this feature.

[better-errors]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/03/12/Rust-1.42.html#useful-line-numbers-in-option-and-result-panic-messages

This attribute is called `#[track_caller]`, which was originally proposed
in [RFC 2091][rfc-2091] way back in July of 2017! If you're writing a function
like `unwrap()` that may panic but should not itself appear in the panic stacktrace, you can put this
annotation on your functions, and the default panic formatter will use it to
print its error message. For example, here is `unwrap` previously:

```rust
pub fn unwrap(self) -> T {
    match self {
        Some(val) => val,
        None => panic!("called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value"),
    }
}
```

It now looks like this:

```rust
#[track_caller]
pub fn unwrap(self) -> T {
    match self {
        Some(val) => val,
        None => panic!("called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value"),
    }
}
```

That's it!

If you are implementing a panic hook yourself, you can use the [caller] method
on `std::panic::Location` to get access to this information.

[caller]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/panic/struct.Location.html#method.caller

### `const fn` improvements

There are [several core language features] you can now use in a `const fn`:

* `if`, `if let`, and `match`
* `while`, `while let`, and `loop`
* the `&&` and `||` operators

You can also [cast to a slice][cast-to-slice]:

```rust
const fn foo() {
  let x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // cast the array to a slice
  let y: &[_] = &x;
}
```

[cast-to-slice]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73862/

### Library changes

Keeping with the theme of `const fn` improvements, [`std::mem::forget` is now
a `const fn`][forget]. Additionally, two new APIs were stabilized this release:

* [`Option::zip`][zip]
* [`vec::Drain::as_slice`][as_slice]

[forget]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73887/
[zip]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.zip
[as_slice]:  https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Drain.html#method.as_slice

See the [detailed release notes][notes] for more.
