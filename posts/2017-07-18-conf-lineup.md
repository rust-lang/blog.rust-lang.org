The Rust Community is holding three major conferences in the near future!

### Aug 18-19: RustConf

[RustConf](http://rustconf.com/) is a two-day event held in **Portland, OR,
USA** on August 18-19. The first day offers tutorials on Rust given directly
by members of the Rust core team, ranging from absolute basics to advanced
ownership techniques. In addition to the training sessions, on Friday there will
be a RustBridge workshop session for people from underrepresented groups in tech,
as well as a session on [Tock](https://www.tockos.org/), the secure embedded operating system.

The second day is the main event, with [talks][rc-talks] at every
level of expertise, covering basic and advanced techniques, experience
reports, guidance on teaching, and interesting libraries.

[Tickets are still on sale!][rc-ticks] We offer a [scholarship][rc-schol] for those
who would otherwise find it difficult to attend. Join us in lovely Portland and
hear about the latest developments in the Rust world!

### April 29-30th & Sept 30-01: Rust Fest

Hot off another successful event in Kyiv earlier this year, we invite
you to join us at [RustFest](http://www.rustfest.eu/), the European
Rust community conference series. Over the weekend of the 30th of
September we’ll gather in **Zürich, Switzerland** to talk Rust, its ecosystem and
community. All day Saturday will have talks with topics ranging from
hardware and testing over concurrency and disassemblers, and all the
way to important topics like community, learning and empathy. While
Sunday has a focus on learning and connecting, either at one of the
many workshops we are hosting or in the central meet-n-greet-n-hack
area provided.

Thanks to the many awesome sponsors, we are able to offer affordable
tickets to go on sale in couple weeks! Keep an eye on
[rustfest.eu](http://www.rustfest.eu/), get all the updates on the
