In 2020 the way we can do events suddenly changed.
In the past we had in-person events all around the world, with some major conferences throughout the year.
With everything changed due to a global pandemic this won't be possible anymore.
Nonetheless the Rust community found ways to continue with events in some form or another.
With more and more events moving online they are getting more accessible to people no matter where they are.

Below you find updated information about Rust events in 2020.

Do you plan to run a Rust online event?
Send an email to the [Rust Community team][community-team] and the team will be able to get your event on the calendar and might be able to offer further help.
