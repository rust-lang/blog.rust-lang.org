---

Every year there are multiple Rust events around the world, bringing together the community.
Despite being early in the year, we're excited to be able to highlight several events
that are already being organized!

This year, one of the Rust Team's primary goals is to [**"Connect and empower Rust’s global community."**].
We'll be working throughout the year to encourage and support Rust events all over the globe.

As always, there are nearly a hundred [Rust User Groups][usergroups] worldwide.
If you haven't already, take a look at the [Rust Community calendar][calendar], to see if there's an upcoming
event near you.

If you are already running a Rust event or are interested in starting one, email the [Rust Community Team][commteam]!
We can offer you support and guidance, as well as advertise the event in blog posts like these.
