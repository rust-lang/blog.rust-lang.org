title: "Announcing Rust 1.77.0"
author: The Rust Release Team
release: true
---

The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.77.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via `rustup`, you can get 1.77.0 with:

```console
$ rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for 1.77.0](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/releases.html#version-77-2024-03-21).

If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (`rustup default beta`) or the nightly channel (`rustup default nightly`). Please [report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose) any bugs you might come across!

## What's in 1.77.0 stable

This release is relatively minor, but as always, even incremental improvements lead to a greater whole. A few of those changes are highlighted in this post, and others may yet fill more niche needs.

### C-string literals

Rust now supports C-string literals (`c"abc"`) which expand to a nul-byte
terminated string in memory of type `&CStr`. This makes it easier to write code
providing nul-terminated strings, with all of the relevant error checking (e.g.,
lack of interior nul byte) performed at compile time.

### `offset_of!`

1.77.0 stabilizes [`offset_of!`] for struct fields, which provides access to the
byte offset of the relevant public field of a struct. This macro is most useful
when the offset of a field is required without an existing instance of a type.
Implementing such a macro is already possible on stable, but without an
instance of the type the implementation would require tricky unsafe code which
makes it easy to get into undefined behavior.

Users can now access the offset of a public field with `offset_of!(StructName,
field)`. This expands to a `usize` expression with the offset in bytes from the
start of the struct.

Note that the output of the macro is not typically stable across compiler
versions or across platforms. See the macro's documentation for details on when the output can be relied on.

### Enable strip in release profiles by default

Cargo [profiles](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html)
which do not enable [debug info](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug) in
outputs (e.g., `debug = 0`) will enable `strip = "debuginfo"` by default.

This is primarily needed because the (precompiled) standard library ships with
debug info, which means that statically linked results would include the
debuginfo from the standard library even if the local compilations didn't
explicitly request debuginfo.

Users which do want debuginfo can explicitly enable it with the
[debug](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug)
flag in the relevant Cargo profile.
