Hello everyone! 

This blog post summarizes the thematically-related meetings of June 4, June 25, and July 9th. 

## Big picture themes
Define the role of domain working groups and community groups in the Rust Project; Rust governance taxonomy

You can find the <br>
[detailed minutes June 4](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.06.04.md)  <br>
[detailed minutes June 25](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.06.25.md)  <br>
[detailed minutes July 9](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.07.09.md)  <br>
on the [wg-governance](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance) repository, but here is a quick summary: <br>

* There is a need for more clarity about why and how groups are formed, 
    * what group categories mean, 
    * how they relate to each other, 
    * how they relate to the Rust Project
    * and their level of decision-making power
* Rust repository structure and permissions should ideally represent status of groups in the project
* There will very likely be a proposal for Community Groups to have their own repositories outside of the Rust project and not be listed in
Rust materials. Instead, it is likely that, to avoid some community groups being perceived to be "more official", 
the Rust project would possibly only link to the [Mozilla Communities Portal](https://community.mozilla.org/), 
and Rust community groups wishing to do outreach could can create profiles there, share events, and generally do promotion and recruitment
* "Pre-FCP" likely going away

## Next meeting
* Our next meeting will be 23 July 2020 via [Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/223182-wg-governance) 18-19 CET / 1pm-2pm EST / 10-11am PST.
* In 2020 the agenda is always at https://hackmd.io/ATj1rZJaRimaIfIWfAOYfQ
* Current agenda is:
    1. Continue with taxonomy work
