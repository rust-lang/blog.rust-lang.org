On [Friday, February 11th][feb-11-zulip-archive], the Rust Compiler team had a planning meeting for the February steering cycle.

[feb-11-zulip-archive]: https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/stream/238009-t-compiler/meetings/topic/.5Bplanning.20meeting.5D.202022-02-11.html

Every fourth Friday, the Rust compiler team decides how
it is going to use its scheduled steering and design meeting time over the next
three Fridays.

On [Friday, 18 February][feb-18-mtg], we will be having a meeting to discuss the
draft blog post describing the compiler team's ambitions for 2022.
pnkfelix and wesleywiser have prepared the post and circulated it amongst the
compiler contributors.

We will be skipping the meeting on Friday, 25 February.

On [Friday, 4 March][mar-04-mtg], we will be having a "backlog bonanza", in a
similar vein to that done by T-lang, to review the list of unimplemented or
partially-implemented features. pnkfelix and Jack Huey will prepare a document to
drive the meeting.

[mar-04-mtg]: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/484

Each meeting will run from 2pm to 3pm GMT, and will take place on the
[T-compiler/meetings zulip stream][zulip].
