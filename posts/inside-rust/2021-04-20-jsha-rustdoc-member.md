Hello everyone, please welcome [Jacob Hoffman-Andrews][@jsha] to the rustdoc team!

Jacob Hoffman-Andrews([@jsha]) has been contributing a lot on rustdoc front-end. Thanks to him, the pageload of the rustdoc pages is much faster. Here is a non-exhaustive list of the stuff he's done recently:

 * The huge search index is now only loaded [when needed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82310).
 * The pageload has [has been optimized a bunch](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82315).
 * Rustdoc's show/hide toggles [are being converted to pure HTML](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83332), reducing complexity and improving pageload performance.

And this is just an overview!

We are really happy to have Jacob joining us, so thanks a lot for your work and congratulations!
