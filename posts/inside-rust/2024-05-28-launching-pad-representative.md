The Leadership Council would like to welcome [James Munns] as the new representative of the Launching Pad. [JP] will be stepping down for personal reasons. We are very grateful for JP being a part of the Leadership Council since its beginning.

The [Launching Pad] is a top-level umbrella team which collects all the teams and working groups that are not directly associated with any other top-level team. It includes groups such as the [Embedded devices Working Group][embedded-wg], which James has been a part of for several years.

We're looking forward to working with James in his new role!
