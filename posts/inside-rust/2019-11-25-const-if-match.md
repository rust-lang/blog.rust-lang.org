title: "`if` and `match` in constants on nightly rust"
author: Dylan MacKenzie
team: WG const-eval <https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval>
---

**TLDR; `if` and `match` are now usable in constants on the latest nightly.**

As a result, you can now write code like the following and have it execute at
compile-time:

```rust
static PLATFORM: &str = if cfg!(unix) {
    "unix"
} else if cfg!(windows) {
    "windows"
} else {
    "other"
};

const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<usize>() == 8, "Only 64-bit platforms are supported");
```

`if` and `match` can also be used in the body of a `const fn`:

```rust
const fn gcd(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    match (a, b) {
        (x, 0) | (0, x) => x,

        (x, y) if x % 2 == 0 && y % 2 == 0 => 2*gcd(x/2, y/2),
        (x, y) | (y, x) if x % 2 == 0 => gcd(x/2, y),

        (x, y) if x < y => gcd((y-x)/2, x),
        (x, y) => gcd((x-y)/2, y),
    }
}
```

## What exactly is going on here?

The following expressions,
- `match`
- `if` and `if let`
- `&&` and `||`

can now appear in any of the following contexts,
- `const fn` bodies
- `const` and associated `const` initializers
- `static` and `static mut` initializers
- array initializers
- const generics (EXPERIMENTAL)

if `#![feature(const_if_match)]` is enabled for your crate.

You may have noticed that the short-circuiting logic operators, `&&` and
`||`, were already legal in a `const` or `static`. This was accomplished by
translating them to their non-short-circuiting equivalents, `&` and `|`
respectively. Enabling the feature gate will turn off this hack and make `&&`
and `||` behave as you would expect.

As a side-effect of these changes, the `assert` and `debug_assert` macros
become usable in a const context if `#![feature(const_panic)]` is also
enabled. However, the other assert macros (e.g., `assert_eq`,
`debug_assert_ne`) remain forbidden, since they need to call `Debug::fmt` on
their arguments.

The looping constructs, `while`, `for`, and `loop` are also forbidden and will
be [feature-gated separately][52000]. As you have seen above, loops can be
emulated with recursion as a temporary measure. However, the non-recursive
version will usually be more efficient since rust does not (to my knowledge)
do tail call optimization.

Finally, the `?` operator remains forbidden in a const context, since its
desugaring contains a call to `From::from`. The design for `const` trait
methods is still being discussed, and both `?` and `for`, which desugars to a
call to `IntoIterator::into_iter`, will not be usable until a final decision is
reached.

## What's next?

This change will allow a great number of standard library functions to be made
`const`. You can help with this process! To get started, here's a [list of
numeric functions][const-int] that can be constified with little effort.
Conversion to a `const fn` requires two steps. First, `const` is added to a
function definition along with a `#[rustc_const_unstable]` attribute. This
allows nightly users to call it in a const context. Then, after a period of
experimentation, the attribute is removed and the constness of that function is
stabilized. See [#61635] for an example of the first step and [#64028] for an
example of the second.

Personally, I've looked forward to this feature for a long time, and I can't
wait to start playing with it. If you feel the same, I would greatly
appreciate if you tested the limits of this feature! Try to sneak `Cell`s and
types with `Drop` impls into places they shouldn't be allowed, blow up the
stack with poorly implemented recursive functions (see `gcd` above), and let
us know if something goes horribly wrong.

## What took you so long?

[The Miri engine][miri], which rust uses under the hood for compile-time
function evaluation, has been capable of this for a while now. However, rust
needs to statically guarantee certain properties about variables in a `const`,
such as whether they allow for interior mutability or whether they have a
`Drop` implementation that needs to be called. For example, we must reject the
following code since it would result in a `const` being mutable at runtime!

[miri]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/miri.html

```rust
const CELL: &std::cell::Cell<i32> = &std::cell::Cell::new(42); // Not allowed...

fn main() {
    CELL.set(0);
    println!("{}", CELL.get()); // otherwise this could print `0`!!!
}
```

However, it is sometimes okay for a `const` to contain a reference to a *type*
that may have interior mutability, as long as we can prove that the actual
*value* of that type does not. This is particularly useful for `enum`s with a
"unit variant" (e.g., `Option::None`).

```rust
const NO_CELL: Option<&std::cell::Cell<i32>> = None; // OK
```

A more detailed (but non-normative) treatment of the rules [for `Drop`][drop]
and [for interior mutability][interior-mut] in a const context can be found
on the [`const-eval`] repo.

It is not trivial to guarantee properties about the value of a variable when
complex control flow such as loops and conditionals is involved. Implementing
this feature required extending the existing dataflow framework in rust so
that we could properly track the value of each local across the control-flow
graph. At the moment, the analysis is very conservative, especially when values are
moved in and out of compound data types. For example, the following will not
compile, even when the feature gate is enabled.

```rust
const fn imprecise() -> Vec<i32> {
    let tuple: (Vec<i32>,) = (Vec::new(),);
    tuple.0
}
```

Even though the `Vec` created by `Vec::new` will never actually be dropped
inside the `const fn`, we don't detect that all fields of `tuple` have been moved
out of, and thus conservatively assume that the drop impl for `tuple` will run.
While this particular case is trivial, there are other, more complex ones that
would require a more comprehensive solution. It is an open question how precise
we want to be here, since more precision means longer compile times, even for
users that have no need for more expressiveness.
