Hello everyone! 

We held another meeting of the Rust Governance Working Group on Zulip on 21 May.
Agenda:

- Domain WG retrospective
- Pre-RFC process

You can find the [detailed minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.05.21.md) 
on the [wg-governance](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance) repository, but here is a quick summary: 
* Domain working groups followup
  - Survey sent, Niko to post on the GitHub issues to indicate no new domain teams are planned for now.
* Proposal procedures / aka "Pre-RFC"
  - Proposal starts from motivation + problem
  - Need supporter to develop proposal into PR/RFC
  - Niko created a [draft RC](https://hackmd.io/StXzJPw7SriuM4COL_YfEw).
