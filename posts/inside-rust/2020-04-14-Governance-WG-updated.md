Greetings Rustaceans!

The Rust Governance Working Group held another meeting on Zulip on 09 April.

The agenda included:
1. Follow up on [the Project Group RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2856)
2. Pre-RFC process
3. Domain Working Group Retrospective

You can find the [detailed minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.04.09.md) on the [wg-governance](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance) repository, but here is a quick summary: 
* Follow up on the [Project Group RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2856)
  * Defined roles of "lead" and "liason" 
* Discussed the initial Pre-RFC process draft
* We ran out of time before getting to the Domain Working Group retrospective, but look forward to covering it at the next meeting!
