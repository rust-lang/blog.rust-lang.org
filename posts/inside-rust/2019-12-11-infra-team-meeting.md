## Feedback on the RFC 2837 draft

pietroalbini gave the team a draft of [RFC
2837](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2837) (then published shortly
after the meeting), about the demotion of Apple 32bit targets to Tier 3 from
Tier 1 and 2 (see the RFC for the motivations leading to that). The team was
largely onboard with it, and everyone gave useful feedback, which was
incorporated into the RFC text. Kinnison also jumped in to clarify the rustup
behavior when a target is removed.
