Following Niko Matsakis' announcement of the [**LLVM ICE-breaker
group**](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2019/10/22/LLVM-ICE-breakers.html),
I'm pleased to announce the **Cleanup Crew ICE-breaker group**. It
follows the same principle, if you know Rust and would like to
contribute to rustc -- but without knowing about the compiler or taking
on a large commitment -- then the Cleanup Crew ICE-breaker group might
well be for you!

### What is the Cleanup Crew ICE-breaker group?

The "Cleanup Crew" are focused on improving bug reports. Specifically,
the goal is to try to ensure that every bug report has all the
information that will be needed for someone to fix it:

- a minimal, standalone example that shows the problem
- links to duplicates or related bugs
- if the bug is a regression (something that used to work, but no
  longer does), then a bisection to the PR or nightly that caused
  the regression

This kind of cleanup is invaluable in getting bugs fixed.

### Who should join?

It can be done by anybody who knows Rust, without any particularly deep
knowledge of the compiler.  If you want to be part of it and be notified
about things to do, just [add yourself to the list][instructions here]! When we come across a suitable
bug, we'll write a message that `@`-mentions every Github user on that
team. If you have some time, maybe you can provide some useful
information.

section](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/ice-breaker/cleanup-crew.html).
