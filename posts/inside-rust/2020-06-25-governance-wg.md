Hello everyone! 

We held another meeting of the Rust Governance Working Group on Zulip on 25 June.
Agenda: Clarify taxonomy of groups in  the Rust Project

You can find the [detailed minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.06.25.md) 
on the [wg-governance](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance) repository, but here is a quick summary: 
- Going forward there will be two types of groups in the Rust organization
    * Teams
    * Project groups parented by those teams, have a charter, do not have final decision-making power
    * Subteams that refine the work of their parent team (e.g. community/events or compiler/prioritization)
    * Subteams cover a defined area, they are not trying to create a project
- The Rust Project will not list or link to any community groups, or keep community projects on its Github
    * If community groups want folks to find them they can create a group on the Mozilla Community Portal, which the Rust Project will link to instead of any individual groups

## Next meeting
* Our next meeting will be 9 July 2020 via [Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/223182-wg-governance) 18-19 CET / 1pm-2pm EST / 10-11am PST.
* Current agenda is:
- Discuss proposal and fit of groups into taxonomy/discussion with groups
