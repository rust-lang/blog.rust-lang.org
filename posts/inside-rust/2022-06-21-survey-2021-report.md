As usual, we conducted an annual community survey in 2021. We previously shared some some highlights and charts
in a [blog post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/02/15/Rust-Survey-2021.html). This year we would also like to
make the complete (-ish) dataset available. We have compiled a report which contains data and charts for nearly
all questions with minimal analysis. We have elided a few sensitive questions and have combined some answers
or elided some answers where there is any chance of respondents being identified or of sensitive data being released.

We intend to produce further small reports with more analysis targetted at specific teams or groups within the
project. If there is any analysis or processed data you'd like to see, please get in touch with the survey working group via
[Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/294169-t-community.2Frust-survey-2021).

Once again, we'd like to thank all the respondents, our translators, and everyone else who helped to make the survey a success!
