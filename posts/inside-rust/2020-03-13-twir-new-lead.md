Vikrant Chaudhary ([@nasa42]) is retiring from [This Week in Rust][twir]. He joined This Week in Rust in June 2015 with issue 84 and has been part of Rust Community team since February 2018. We'd like to thank Vikrant for his stewardship of TWiR these past five years, and making TWiR one of the community's favourite newsletters. We wish him all the best in his future projects.

TWiR is now looking for a new lead maintainer. To help smooth the transition, Vikrant will be writing TWiR for 4 more weeks while we onboard a new maintainer. If you're interested please, express your interest on our [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/emberian/this-week-in-rust/issues/1167).
