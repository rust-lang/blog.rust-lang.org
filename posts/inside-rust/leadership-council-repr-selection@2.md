The selection process for representatives on the [Leadership Council] is starting today.

Every six months, half of the council terms end.
This is the second half of the rotation since the first rotation done in [March 2024].
The following teams (and their current representatives) are up to choose their representative for the next year:

* [Infra] — [Mark Rousskov]
* [Lang] — [Jack Huey]
* [Libs] — [Mara Bos]
* [Mods] — [Josh Gould]

We are aiming to have the teams confirm their choices by September 20, 2024, and for any possible new members to be ready to join the council meetings starting September 27th.

## Criteria for representatives

Any member of the top-level team or a member of any of their subteams is eligible to be the representative.
See [candidate criteria] for a description of what makes a good representative.

[candidate criteria]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/governance/council.html#candidate-criteria

There is a limit of at most two people affiliated with the same company or other legal entity being on the council [^affiliates].
During the selection process, the council will consider the affiliation of candidates to decide if all choices will be compatible with that constraint.
Note that the council is currently investigating clarifications and changes to affiliation limits, but we do not expect these changes to be ready before this selection process is over.

Representatives may serve multiple terms if the team decides to choose the same representative again.
There is a soft limit of three terms.[^limit]
It is recommended that teams rotate their representatives if possible to help avoid burnout and to spread the experience to a broader group of people.

[^affiliates]: See [Limits on representatives from a single company/entity](https://forge.rust-lang.org/governance/council.html#limits-on-representatives-from-a-single-companyentity)

[^limit]: See [Term limits](https://forge.rust-lang.org/governance/council.html#term-limits).

## What do Representatives do?

A representative provides a voice on the council to represent the interests of their teams and contribute to the long-term success of the Rust Project.
A detailed description of the role may be found at the [Representative Role Description][role].

## How should teams make their selection?

The Leadership Council has put together a recommended [Representative Selection Guide][guide] for how teams should choose their representative.
It is not a requirement that teams follow this guide; top-level teams may choose their own process.
