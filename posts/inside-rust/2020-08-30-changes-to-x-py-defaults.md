title: "Changes to x.py defaults"

Recently, the defaults for [`x.py`], the tool used to [bootstrap] the Rust compiler from source, changed. If you regularly contribute to Rust, this might affect your workflow.

## What changes were made?

- The default stage is now dependent on the subcommand:
  + `dist`: stage 2
  + `build`: stage 1
  + `test`: stage 1
  + `doc`: stage 0

- stage 1 `rustc` artifacts are no longer built by `x.py build --stage 1`. To get the old behavior back, use `x.py build --stage 1 src/rustc`. The new behavior for `build --stage 1` builds everything except `rustc`, which includes the standard library, `rustdoc`, and various other tools (if the tools are enabled).

- `debuginfo` now defaults to `1` when `debug = true`. Previously, the default was 2.

## Why were the changes made?

Previously, `x.py build` would build `rustc` twice:

1. `build/stage0-std`
2. `build/stage0-rustc`
3. `build/stage1-std`
4. `build/stage1-rustc`

Normally, contributors only want to build the compiler once, which lets them test their changes quickly. After this change, that's now the default:

1. `build/stage0-std`
2. `build/stage0-rustc`
3. `build/stage1-std`

`debuginfo = 2` generates several gigabytes of debug information,
making the previous default settings for `debug = true` very painful.
