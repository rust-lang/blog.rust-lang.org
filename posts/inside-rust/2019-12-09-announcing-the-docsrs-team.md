title: "Announcing the Docs.rs Team"
author: QuietMisdreavus
team: The Rustdoc Team <https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/dev-tools#rustdoc>

Today we're announcing a brand new team: The Docs.rs Team!

Previously, [Docs.rs] has been managed by the Rustdoc Team, as many of the initial concerns of
Docs.rs were shared by Rustdoc as Docs.rs was being brought into team maintainership. However, as
time went on, those concerns started to diverge more and more, and so did the people who contributed
to either tool.

The new Docs.rs Team will be responsible for the operations and development for [Docs.rs], leaving
the Rustdoc Team to be responsible for the Rustdoc tool itself. [@QuietMisdreavus] will be leading
the new Docs.rs Team, leaving [@GuillaumeGomez] to lead the Rustdoc Team.

Joining QuietMisdreavus on the Docs.rs Team is GuillaumeGomez, coordinating work between Rustdoc and
Docs.rs; [@onur], the original creator of Docs.rs; [@pietroalbini], who has coordinated work in
Docs.rs from the perspective of the Infrastrucure Team; and introducing [@jyn514], who has worked to
improve the developer experience of contributing to Docs.rs by converting the local development
configuration to use `docker-compose`!

To get involved with either team, join us on Discord! The Rustdoc Team hangs out in [`#rustdoc`],
and the Docs.rs Team hangs out in [`#docs-rs`].
