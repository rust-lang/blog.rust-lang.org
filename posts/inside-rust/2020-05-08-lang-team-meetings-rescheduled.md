+++

The Rust language team holds two weekly meetings:

- The triage meeting, where we go through open items that need language team
  review or guidance.
- The design meeting, where we do in-depth dives and explorations on a specific
  proposal, issue, or idea.

To better accommodate the schedules of lang team members and other regular
attendees, we've rescheduled the time slots for both of these meetings.

- The triage meeting now takes place on Mondays from 12-1pm US/Pacific.
- The design meeting now takes place on Wednesdays from 10-11am US/Pacific.

These meetings are open to the public; you can find the details on the lang
team calendar. For more information on how to subscribe to the lang team
calendar, see the README in the [lang team
repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team).
