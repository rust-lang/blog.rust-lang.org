title: "Governance Working Group Update: Meeting 4 June 2020"

Hello everyone! 

We held another meeting of the Rust Governance Working Group on Zulip on 4 June.
Agenda:
- Domain WG 
- Group taxonomy


You can find the [detailed minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2020.05.21.md) 
on the [wg-governance](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance) repository, but here is a quick summary: 
- Domain working group application process does not work
- With too many groups there is no focus
- Why are groups formed and what are they for?
    * Bring in new people, fill in gaps, build up expertise, improve existing ecosystem
    * Move the Rust Project forward toward specific goals
- We need a clear taxonomy of what groups are and what they are for

## Next meeting
* Our next meeting will be 25 June 2020 via [Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/223182-wg-governance) 18-19 CET / 1pm-2pm EST / 10-11am PST.
* In 2020 the agenda is always at https://hackmd.io/ATj1rZJaRimaIfIWfAOYfQ
* Current agenda is:
    1. Domain Working Group changes
    2. Group taxonomy
