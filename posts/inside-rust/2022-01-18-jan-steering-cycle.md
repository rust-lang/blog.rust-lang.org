On [Friday, January 14th][jan-14-zulip-archive], the Rust Compiler team had a planning meeting for the January steering cycle.

[jan-14-zulip-archive]: https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/stream/238009-t-compiler/meetings/topic/.5Bplanning.20meeting.5D.202022-01-14.html

Every fourth Friday, the Rust compiler team decides how
it is going to use its scheduled steering and design meeting time over the next
three Fridays.

On [Friday, 28 January][jan-28-mtg], we will be having a meeting to
discuss the  backlog of P-high issues (there are currently [86 such issues][p-high-issue-list]). pnkfelix will prepare a document to drive the meeting, with a categorization of the issues, especially in terms of how they relate to specific subteams.

[jan-28-mtg]: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/479
[p-high-issue-list]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AP-high

On Friday, 4 February, we will be having a meeting to
discuss any beta regressions or backports that are pending for the
Rust 1.59 release (due out 24 February, 2022). (We did not file a
meeting proposal for this meeting, but you can see a similar meeting
proposal that was used to drive an analogous meeting for the 1.48 release
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/382).)

Each meeting will run from 2pm to 3pm GMT, and will take place on the
[T-compiler/meetings zulip stream][zulip].
