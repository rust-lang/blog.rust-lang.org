The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.34.2. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.34.2 is as easy as:

```console
rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website.

## What's in 1.34.2 stable

Sean McArthur reported a [security vulnerability][ml] affecting the standard
library that caused the [`Error::downcast`][Error::downcast] family of methods
to perform unsound casts when a manual implementation of the
[`Error::type_id`][Error::type_id] method returned the wrong
[`TypeId`][TypeId], leading to security issues such as out of bounds
reads/writes/etc.

The [`Error::type_id`][Error::type_id] method was recently stabilized as part
of Rust 1.34.0. This point release **destabilizes** it, preventing any code on
the stable and beta channels to implement or use it, awaiting future plans that
will be discussed in [issue #60784][60784].

An in-depth explaination of this issue was posted in yesterday's [security
advisory][ml]. The assigned CVE for the vulnerability is [CVE-2019-12083][cve].
