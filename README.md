# The Rust blog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org)

This is the blog of the Rust Programming Language.

It's implemented as a small static site generator, that's deployed to GitHub
Pages via Travis.

## Building

To build the site locally:

```console
> git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org
> cd blog.rust-lang.org
> cargo run
```

You could do it in release mode if you'd like, but it's pretty fast in debug.

From there, the generated HTML will be in a `site` directory. You can use
any web server to check it out in your browser:

```console
> cd site
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 
```

The site is now available at <0.0.0.0:8000>.
